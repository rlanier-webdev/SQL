## üîç Highlighted Query Example

```sql
-- Find artists who were nominated but never won
SELECT artist
FROM awards
GROUP BY artist
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN winner = 'TRUE' THEN 1 END) = 0;
```
This query identifies artists who received at least one nomination but never won a Grammy, using a CASE statement inside an aggregate function to count only wins.
