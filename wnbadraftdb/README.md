# üèÄ WNBA Draft SQL Analysis

## üìò Overview

This project explores WNBA Draft data from **1997 to 2022** using SQL. It includes a wide range of queries to analyze player performance, team selection trends, and college-level stats. The goal was to deepen my SQL skills through practical, sports-oriented data analysis and produce insights from real-world-style datasets.

| 1  | Identified all players drafted in the year 2000                                | `WHERE` filter                     |
| 3  | Calculated total points scored per player and filtered those over 500          | `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`        |
| 6  | Listed top 5 players with highest win shares                                   | `ORDER BY`, `TOP`                  |
| 11 | Found the college with most draftees                                           | `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `TOP`         |
| 18 | Ranked players by total points using `RANK()`                                  | Window functions                   |
| 20 | Selected top win share players per year using a `JOIN` with aggregate subquery | Subqueries, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`     |

## üîç Highlighted Query Example

```sql
-- Rank players by total points scored
SELECT player, 
    SUM(games * points) AS total_points, 
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(games * points) DESC) AS Rank
FROM Picks 
GROUP BY player
ORDER BY total_points DESC;
```
This query ranks players based on their total point contribution across seasons. It uses a window function combined with aggregation to build a performance leaderboard.
