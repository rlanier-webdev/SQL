|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 5  | Retrieved top 5 most expensive products                                                      | `ORDER BY`, `TOP`                        |
| 12 | Calculated total orders placed by each customer                                              | `JOIN`, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`              |
| 13 | Calculated total revenue per product                                                         | `SUM`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`                |
| 17 | Found customers who spent more than $500 using a subquery                                    | Subquery with `IN`                       |
| 27 | Identified all products never ordered                                                        | `LEFT JOIN`, `IS NULL`                   |
| 29 | Retrieved customers who purchased a specific product (e.g., Laptop)                          | Subquery, `JOIN`                         |
| 32 | Validated orders where total doesn‚Äôt match sum of OrderDetails prices                        | `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`             |

## üîç Highlighted Query Example

```sql
-- Find mismatched order totals between Orders and OrderDetails
SELECT Orders.order_id, 
    Orders.total_amount AS total, 
    SUM(OrderDetails.price) AS calculated_total
FROM Orders
JOIN OrderDetails ON OrderDetails.order_id = Orders.order_id
GROUP BY Orders.order_id, Orders.total_amount
HAVING SUM(OrderDetails.price) <> Orders.total_amount;
```
This query identifies data inconsistencies between what customers were charged and the actual sum of itemized prices.
